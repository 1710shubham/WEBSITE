	<h1><u>ABOUT</u></h1>
<ul>
<li>
	<p>
ACCOUNTABILITY. The whole essence of a wristwatch, the function of it is to tell the time. There are still fields in our industries where wearing a watch and time are extremely important. Pilots, Airline Stewardesses, Businessmen and women, Stock Brokers, Military Men, Home Designers, Caterers.</p></li>


<li>
	<p>
The watch brand should have a long standing history of quality craftsmanship with attention to detail. You can also tell a lot about the watch company from their after sales service and their long term commitment to servicing your watch</p></li>

<p>
The individual brand websites are great, but there are hundreds of watch brands in Switzerland alone, so checking out each page individually would take you weeks, and that’s if you know the names of all the brands.

<p>
There is nowhere you can really search for all the new watches on the planet, compare models, check prices, and discover new brands all in the same place. That is, until now!

<p>
The idea for the site came about because people were often asking for advice about which watch they should buy. The more this happened — and it happened a lot — the more we realized that searching for a watch online is a minefield of information.
