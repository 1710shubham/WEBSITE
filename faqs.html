    <h1>FAQs</h1>
    <p>
        Q:Where is my order?<br>
        A:All orders are processed and shipped out by 5pm (PST) Monday through Friday. Orders received after 12pm (PST) will be processed the next business day. All shipping times are estimates provided to us by our shipping partners. Weather or missed delivery attempts can often be a factor in delayed shipments. Also international shipments can often be delayed due to high variance with each country’s customs processing. To track your package, just find your shipping confirmation email from us and click Track Package. If you choose Route Package Protection during checkout then find the shipping email from Route to see your upgrading tracking abilities.

        Q:Can I cancel my order?<br>
        A:Orders are processed and sent to our fulfillment center within 20 minutes of the order being completed. We can cancel an order at no charge if we are notified within 15 minutes of your order being placed. Please call us at 925-820-4300 between 8am-5pm Pacific Standard Time for immediate assistance. Emails will not guarantee order cancellations, as they are answered in the order they are received. Orders cannot be cancelled after this 15 minute window. Preorders and special orders cannot be cancelled as the funds have already been sent to the manufacturer to secure your watch.

    Q:Can I apply more than one coupon code per order?<br>

    Q:How does my watch work?<br>
    A:Your watch should have an instruction booklet for specific functionality. Some eco-friendly brands (example: Vestal) do not provide a printed instructional manual, but make the instruction manuals available for download on their brand website. If you need additional help, we would be more than happy to assist you. Visit our Contact Us page.

    Q:What do the water resistance ratings mean?<br>
    A:Water Resistance indicates how well a watch is sealed against the ingress of water. It is usually accompanied by an indication of the static test pressure that a sample of newly manufactured watches were exposed to in a leakage test. An indication of the test pressure in terms of water depth does not mean a water resistant watch was designed for repeated long-term use in such water depths.
